# Route-Optimization-AI-Model-with-React-Native-Maps-Integration

# Introduction
This document explains how the AI model work for route optimization using a Q-learning algorithm integrated with React Native Maps. The model optimizes walking routes by efficiently navigating through GPS coordinates and paths, utilizing OpenStreetMap and Elevation API data for realistic route decisions.
# 1. Problem Definition
The model's objective is to optimize walking routes for users by identifying the most efficient path based on distance and terrain conditions. The environment is represented by GPS coordinates on a map displayed via react-native-maps. The AI model simulates user movement between key landmarks, with decisions driven by Q-learning principles. Actions involve selecting the best waypoint transition, while rewards reinforce shorter, efficient routes and penalize inefficient paths.
The model effectively mirrors real-world walking navigation by rewarding shorter and safer paths while penalizing complex or lengthy routes. Additionally, challenging terrains are identified via elevation data to ensure realistic path planning.
# 2. Data Requirements
The AI model uses a defined set of waypoints representing key London landmarks as the state space. The available actions are movement choices between these waypoints. The model’s reward system positively reinforces efficient paths and applies penalties for longer routes or challenging terrains. Elevation data is integrated via the Open Elevation API to enhance route accuracy.
In RouteMap.js, the user's real-time GPS location is captured using expo-location to dynamically adjust starting points in the optimized route calculation. This ensures real-world adaptability. The Q-learning model leverages OpenStreetMap’s API to calculate distance-based penalties while the Elevation API enhances route accuracy by accounting for terrain changes.
# 3. Key Components
Q-Learning Algorithm
The model implements Q-learning with a Q-table to store state-action values. The epsilon-greedy policy balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring the agent explores new routes while prioritizing known optimal paths. The Q-table is updated during training using the Bellman equation:
Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+α×[r+γ×max⁡aQ(s′,a)−Q(s,a)]Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + \alpha \times [r + \gamma \times \max_a Q(s', a) - Q(s, a)] 
This equation ensures Q-values are adjusted to favor optimal decisions over time.
Training Process
The model undergoes multiple training episodes, with the agent learning optimal paths by exploring available routes, earning rewards for efficient paths, and receiving penalties for longer or elevation-heavy routes. Each episode trains the model to select the best path to reach the goal efficiently.
Route Evaluation
Upon completing training, the model uses the learned Q-table to evaluate and determine the optimal walking route. The getOptimizedPath() function leverages Q-values to compute the most efficient path between the start and end locations.

# 4. System Implementation
The AI model is implemented in three key files:
•	Q-learning model.py — Handles model training, Q-table generation, and API data integration.
•	server.js — A Node.js server that processes user requests, loads the Q-table, and computes optimized routes.
•	RouteMap.js — A React Native interface that displays the user’s current location and optimized routes via react-native-maps.
Data Flow
1.	Training Phase: The Q-learning model trains using sample waypoints and API data. The trained Q-table is saved in q_table.json.
2.	Server Phase: The Node.js server loads the Q-table and accepts requests for optimized routes. Upon receiving start and end coordinates, it calculates the optimal path and returns route data.
3.	Route Visualization: The RouteMap.js file fetches optimized route data from the server and displays it visually on a map using markers and polylines.

# 5. How the Model Works
 Objective Fulfillment: The model optimizes walking routes effectively by utilizing a trained Q-learning model that identifies the most efficient paths based on defined waypoints and elevation data. The model’s reward system encourages optimal pathfinding, ensuring that the chosen route is both time-efficient and practical.
 Map Visualization: The integration of react-native-maps in RouteMap.js ensures the walking route is displayed visually with clear markers for the user's location and the calculated route. The use of polylines enhances the route's visibility.
 AI Model Decision Making: The Q-learning algorithm employs a Q-table that dynamically updates state-action values. Through epsilon-greedy exploration, the model efficiently learns optimal paths while minimizing inefficient movements.
 Reward System: The implemented reward mechanism assigns positive values for efficient paths and penalizes routes with increased distance or steep elevation changes. This ensures the chosen routes align with practical walking preferences.
Dynamic GPS Integration: The RouteMap.js file captures the user’s real-time GPS coordinates using expo-location, dynamically setting the starting point in route calculations to provide accurate and adaptable navigation.
